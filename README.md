## 🏗️ SIEM Stack Deployment *In Progress*

### 🛠️ Wazuh + ELK Stack (Self-hosted)
- Building and configuring a full open-source SIEM solution on Ubuntu 22.04
- Components:
  - **Wazuh Manager + Agents**: for log collection & rule-based detection
  - **Elasticsearch + Logstash**: for log indexing and pipeline management
  - **Kibana**: for visualization and dashboarding

#### 🔍 Key Functionalities:
- Centralized log ingestion from Linux endpoints
- File integrity monitoring (FIM) and rootkit detection
- Custom alert rules and decoders
- GeoIP & threat intelligence enrichment
- Role-based access via Kibana
